# Cinema-Room-Manager
A program to manage a cinema theater. It allows booking a seat, checking and managing prices and generating statistics such as total income, available seats etc.

This is my java implementation of a project from hyperskill.

### The objective of the project is:
- To help cinema manager to easily manage the theater ticket sale
- To allow and manage customer seat booking
- Charge customers ticket price based on the selected seat. Prices are 10$ for rooms <60 capacity. For rooms >60 seats, 10$ for first half and $8 for the rest
- Generate live statistics about total income, available seats and percentages.
